<ul>
<li><strong>Two’s complement</strong> – each binary digit is reversed and 1 is added in right-most position to produce another method of representing positive and negative numbers.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>We use two&rsquo;s complement to represent negative number. The two’s complement uses these weightings for an 8-bit number representation:
$−128\space\space\space\space64\space\space\space\space32\space\space\space\space16\space\space\space\space8  4\space\space\space\space2\space\space\space\space1$</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>EXAMPLE 1
10011010 is written in two&rsquo;s complement.
the denary value it represents is calculated by:
-128 + 16 + 8 + 2 = -102</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>EXAMPLE 2
calculate 49 - 80 in binary.
first, them into binary form.
49 = 00110001, 80 = 01010000
then, convert 80 into two&rsquo;s complement.
-80 = 10110000
at last, add 49 and -80 together.
00110001 + 10110000 = 11100001</p>

colours in a pixel.</li>
<li><strong>Bit depth</strong> – number of bits used to represent the
smallest unit in.</li>
<li><strong>Image resolution</strong> – number of pixels that make up an
image, for example, an image could contain 4096 × 3192 pixels.</li>
<li><strong>Screen resolution</strong> – number of horizontal and vertical
pixels that make up a screen display.
If the screen resolution is smaller than the image resolution, the whole image cannot be shown on the screen, or the original image will become lower quality.</li>
<li><strong>Resolution</strong> – number of pixels per column and per row on a monitor or television screen.</li>
<li><strong>Pixel density</strong> – number of pixels per square centimetre.</li>
<li><strong>Vector graphics</strong> – images that use 2D points to describe lines and curves and their properties that are grouped to form geometric shapes.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>benefits of vector graphics:</p>

<hr>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Lossless file compression is particularly important for files
where loss of any data would be disastrous.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>perceptual music shaping is lossy compression. It removes certain sounds, including:</p>

<p>Private networks are often LANs or intranets with restricted user access, for example, passwords and user ids are required to join the network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>many organisations will use the network and there are
usually no specific password requirements to enter the network. but sub-networks may be under security management.</p>
<h3 id="22-lan-and-wan">2.2 LAN and WAN</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>WAN</strong> – wide area network (network covering a very
large geographical area).</li>
<li><strong>LAN</strong> – local area network (network covering a small
area such as a single building).</li>
<li><strong>MAN</strong> – metropolitan area network (network which
is larger than a LAN but smaller than a WAN, which
can cover several buildings in a single city, such as a
university campus).</li>
<li><strong>Hub</strong> – hardware used to connect together a number
of devices to form a LAN that directs incoming data
packets to all devices on the network (LAN).</li>
<li><strong>Switch</strong> – hardware used to connect together a number of devices to form a LAN that directs incoming data packets to a specific destination address only.</li>
<li><strong>Router</strong> – device which enables data packets to be
routed between different networks (for example, can
join LANs to form a WAN).</li>
<li><strong>Modem</strong> – modulator demodulator. A device that
converts digital data to analogue data (to be sent down a telephone wire); conversely it also converts analogue data to digital data (which a computer can process).</li>
<li><strong>WLAN</strong> – wireless LAN.</li>
<li><strong>(W)AP</strong> – (wireless) access point which allows a device
to access a LAN without a wired connection.</li>
<li><strong>PAN</strong> – network that is centred around a person or their workspace.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The following is used as a guide for deciding the ‘size’ of a network:
WAN: 100 km to over 1000 km
MAN: 1 km to 100 km
LAN: 10 m to 1000 m
PAN: 1 m to 10 m</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A typical LAN consists of a number of computers and devices (such as printers) connected to hubs or switches. One of the hubs or switches is usually connected to a router and/or modem to allow the LAN to connect to the internet or become part of a wide area network (WAN).</p>

<h3 id="23-networking-models">2.3 Networking models</h3>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>Client-server</strong> – network that uses separate dedicated
servers and specific client workstations. All client
computers are connected to the dedicated servers.</li>
<li><strong>Node</strong> – device connected to a network (it can be a
computer, storage device or peripheral device).</li>
<li><strong>Peer-to-peer</strong> – network in which each node can share its files with all the other nodes. Each node has its own data and there is no central server.
<strong>File server</strong> – a server on a network where central files and other data are stored. They can be accessed by a user logged onto the network.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Client-Server model</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>sharing of data is the most important part of the client-server model.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Client sends a request to the server and the server finds the                 requested data and sends it back to the client.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A system administrator manages the whole network; clients are connected through a network; allows data access even over large distances.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Users are able to access most of the files, which are stored on dedicated servers. The server dictates which users are able to access which files.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Benefits:</p>
<ol>
<li>The client-server model allows the installation of software onto a client’s computer.</li>
<li>The model uses central security databases which control access to the shared resources. Once a user is logged into the system, they will have access to only those resources (such as a printer) and files assigned to them by the network administrator, so offers greater security than peer-to-peer networks.</li>
<li>Client-server networks can be as large as you want them to be and they are much easier to scale up than peer-to-peer networks.</li>
<li>This model offers the most stable system, for example, if someone deletes a shared resource from the server, the nightly back-up would restore the deleted resource.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Drawback:</p>
<ol>
<li>Client-server networks can become bottlenecked if there are several client requests at the same time.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the client-server model, a file server is used and is responsible for</p>
<ul>
<li>central storage and management of data files, thus enabling other network users to access files</li>
<li>allowing users to share information without the need for offline devices(such as a memory stick)</li>
<li>allowing any computer to be configured as the host machine and act as the file server (note that the server could be a storage device (such as SSD or HDD) that could also serve as a remote storage device for other computers, thus allowing them to access this device as if it were a local storage device attached to their computer).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>when to use:</p>
<ol>
<li>The company/user has a large user-base</li>
<li>Access to network resources needs to be properly controlled</li>
<li>There is a need for good network security</li>
<li>The company requires its data to be free from accidental loss</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Peer-to-peer model</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>connectivity is the most important aspect.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On a peer-to-peer network, each node joins the network to allow:</p>
<ul>
<li>the provision of services to all other network users; the services available are listed on a nominated ‘look up’ computer – when a node requests a service, the ‘look up’ computer is contacted to find out which of the other network nodes can provide the required service</li>
<li>other users on the network to simply access data from another node</li>
<li>communication with other peers connected to the network</li>
<li>peers to be both suppliers and consumers (unlike the client-server model where consumers and resources are kept entirely separate from each other)</li>
<li>peers to participate as equals on the network (again this is different to the client-server model where a webserver and client have different responsibilities).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>The peer-to-peer model does not have a central server. Each of the nodes (workstations) on the network can share its files with all the other nodes, and each of the nodes will have its own data.</li>
<li>Because there is no central storage, there is no requirement to authenticate users.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Drawbacks:</p>
<ul>
<li>This model is used in scenarios where no more than 10 nodes are required where it is relatively easy for users to be in contact with each other on a regular basis. More than 10 nodes leads to performance and management issues.</li>
<li>Peer-to-peer offers little data security since there is no central security system.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>when to use:</p>
<ul>
<li>The network of users is fairly small.</li>
<li>There is no need for robust security.</li>
<li>They require workstation-based applications rather than being server-based.</li>

<h3 id="25-network-topologies">2.5 Network topologies</h3>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>Packet</strong> – message/data sent over a network from node to node (packets include the address of the node sending the packet, the address of the packet recipient and the actual data).</li>
<li><strong>Hub</strong> – hardware used to connect together a number
of devices to form a LAN that directs incoming data
packets to all devices on the network (LAN).</li>
<li><strong>Switch</strong> – hardware used to connect together a number of devices to form a LAN that directs incoming data packets to a specific destination address only.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>bus network topology</strong> – network using single central
cable in which all devices are connected to this cable so
data can only travel in one direction and only one device
is allowed to transmit at a time.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>disadvantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the main cable fails, the whole network goes down.</li>
<li>The performance of the network deteriorates under heavy loading.</li>
<li>The network is not secure since each packet passes through every node.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Even if one node fails, the remainder of the network continues to function.</li>
<li>It is easy to increase the size of the network by adding additional nodes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>In bus network topology, each node looks at each packet and determines whether or not the address of the recipient in the package matches the node address. If so, the node accepts the packet; if not, the packet is ignored.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These are most suitable for situations with a small number of devices with light traffic occurring.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Star network topology</strong> – a network that uses a central hub/switch with all devices connected to this central hub/switch so all data packets are directed through this central hub/switch.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>disadvantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>The initial installation costs are high.</li>
<li>If the central hub/switch fails, then the whole network goes down.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data collisions are greatly reduced due to the topology.</li>
<li>It is a more secure network since security methods can be applied to the central node and packets only travel to nodes with the correct address.</li>
<li>It is easy to improve by simply installing an upgraded hub.</li>
<li>If one of the connections is broken it only affects one of the nodes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>How packets are handled depends on whether the central node is a switch or a hub.</p>
<ul>
<li>If it is a hub, all the packets will be sent to every device/node on the star network – if the address in the packet matches that of the node, it will be accepted; otherwise, it is ignored (this is similar to the way packets are handled on a bus network).</li>
<li>If the central node is a switch, packets will only be sent to nodes where the address matches the recipient address in the packet. The latter is clearly more secure, since only nodes intended to see the packet will receive it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Star networks are useful for evolving networks where devices are frequently added or removed. They are well suited to applications where there is heavy data traffic.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mesh network topology</strong> – interlinked computers/
devices, which use routing logic so data packets are
sent from sending stations to receiving stations only by the shortest route.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There are two types of mesh network topologies: <strong>routing</strong> and <strong>flooding</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Routing works by giving the nodes routing logic (in other words, they act like a router) so that data is directed to its destination by the shortest route and can be re-routed if one of the nodes in the route has failed.</li>
<li>Flooding simply sends the data via all the nodes and uses no routing logic, which can lead to unnecessary loading on the network. It is a type of peer-to-peer network, but is fundamentally different.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Disadvantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>A large amount of cabling is needed, which is expensive and time consuming.</li>
<li>Set-up and maintenance is difficult and complex.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is easy to identify where faults on the network have occurred.</li>
<li>Any broken links in the network do not affect the other nodes.</li>
<li>Good privacy and security, since packets travel along dedicated routes.</li>
<li>The network is relatively easy to expand.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Applications:</p>
<ul>
<li>The internet and WANs/MANs are typical uses of mesh networks.</li>
<li>Many examples include industrial monitoring and control where sensors are set up in mesh design and feedback to a control system which is part of the mesh.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hybrid network</strong> – network made up of a combination of other network topologies.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The main advantages and disadvantages depend on
which types of network are used to make up the hybrid network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>an additional disadvantage is that they can be very complex to install, configure and maintain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>additional advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>They can handle large volumes of traffic.</li>
<li>It is easy to identify where a network fault has occurred.</li>
<li>They are very well suited to the creation of larger networks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>the handling of packets in hybrid networks will depend on which of the above topologies are used to make up the hybrid structure.</p>

<h3 id="26-cloud-computing">2.6 Cloud computing</h3>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cloud storage</strong> – method of data storage where data is stored on off-site servers.</li>
<li><strong>Data redundancy</strong> – situation in which the same data is stored on several servers in case of maintenance or repair.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Three common systems:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Public cloud</em> is a storage environment where the customer/client and cloud storage provider are different companies.</li>
<li><em>Private cloud</em> is storage provided by a dedicated environment behind a company firewall. Customer/client and cloud storage provider are integrated and operate as a single entity.</li>
<li><em>Hybrid cloud</em> is a combination of private and public clouds. Some data resides in the private cloud and less sensitive/less commercial data can be accessed from a public cloud storage provider.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pros of using cloud storage:</p>
<ul>
<li>customer/client files stored on the cloud can be accessed at any time from any device anywhere in the world provided internet access is available</li>
<li>no need for a customer/client to carry an external storage device with them, or use the same computer to store and retrieve information</li>
<li>provides the user with remote back-up of data to aid data loss and disaster recovery</li>
<li>recovers data if a customer/client has a hard disk or back-up device failure</li>
<li>offers almost unlimited storage capacity</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cons of using cloud storage:</p>
<ul>
<li>if the customer/client has a slow or unstable internet connection, they would have problems accessing or downloading their data/files</li>
<li>costs can be high if large storage capacity is required</li>
<li>expensive to pay for high download/upload data transfer limits with the customer/client internet service provider (ISP)</li>
<li>potential failure of the cloud storage company is possible – this poses a risk of loss of all back-up data</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="27-wired-and-wireless-networking">2.7 Wired and wireless networking</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Wireless networking</p>
<ul>
<li>It is easier to expand networks and is not necessary to connect devices using cables.</li>
<li>Devices have increased mobility, provided they are within range of the WAPs.</li>
<li>Increased chance of interference from external sources.</li>
<li>Data is less secure than with wired systems; it is easier to intercept radio waves and microwaves than cables so it is essential to protect data transmissions using encryption (such as WEP, WPA2).</li>
<li>Data transmission rate is slower than wired networks (although it is improving).</li>
<li>Signals can be stopped by thick walls (in old houses, for example) and signal strength can vary, or ‘drop out’.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wired networking</p>
<ul>
<li>More reliable and stable network (wireless connectivity is often subjected to interference).</li>
<li>Data transfer rates tend to be faster with no ‘dead spots’.</li>
<li>Tends to be cheaper overall, in spite of the need to buy and install cable.</li>
<li>Devices are not mobile; they must be close enough to allow for cable connections.</li>
<li>Lots of wires can lead to tripping hazards, overheating of connections (potential fire risk) and disconnection of cables during routine office cleaning.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other considerations</p>
<ul>
<li>If mobile phones and tablets are connected to the network, it will need to offer Wi-Fi or Bluetooth capability.</li>
<li>There may be regulations in some countries regarding which wireless transmission frequencies can be used legally.</li>
<li>Permission from authorities and land owners may be required before laying cables underground.</li>
<li>There are numerous competing signals in the air around us; it is important to consider this when deciding whether to go for wired or wireless connectivity.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Ethernet</strong> – Ethernet is a protocol used by many wired LANs.
<ul>
<li>Ethernet supports broadcast transmission (communications where pieces of data are sent from sender to receiver) and are used to send messages to all devices connected to a LAN. The risk is that two messages using the same data channel could be sent at the same time, leading to a collision.</li>
<li>Carrier sense multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD) was developed to try and resolve this issue.</li>
<li>Collison detection depends on simple physics: when a frame
is sent it causes a voltage change on the Ethernet cable.</li>
<li>When a collision is detected, a node stops transmitting a frame and transmits a ‘jam’ signal and then waits for a random time interval before trying to resend the frame. CSMA/CD protocol will define the random time period for a device to wait before trying again.</li>

<p>Classless inter-domain routing (CIDR) reduces this problem by increasing the flexibility of the IPv4 system. A suffix is used, such as 192.30.250.00/18, which means 18 bits will be used for the net ID and the last 14 bits will be used for the host ID.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>IPv6 uses 128-bit addressing, which allows for much more complex addressing structures. An IPv6 address is broken into 16-bit chunks and because of this, it adopts the hexadecimal notation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>EXAMPLE 1: IPv6 address

<p>Private IP addresses are reserved for internal use behind a router or other NAT device. IP addresses that belong to class A, B or C are reserved for Private IP addresses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Private IP addresses (which are internal value only) allow for an entirely separate set of addresses within a network. They allow access to the network without taking up a public IP address space. However, devices using these private IP addresses cannot be reached by internet users.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Public IP addresses are the ones allocated by a user’s ISP to identify the location of their device. Devices using these IP addresses are accessible from anybody using the internet. Public IP addresses are used by
» DNS servers
» network routers
» directly-controlled computers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dynamic IP addresses are temporary and may have been
assigned to a device on the network. A new one is reallocated each time a device connects to the internet.</p>

<p>Memory is usually referred to as the internal devices which the computer can access directly. This memory can be the user’s workspace, temporary data or data that is key to running the computer.</p>
</li>

<li>Secondary storage
<ul>
<li>Secondary storage includes storage devices that are not directly accessible by the CPU.</li>
<li>They are non-volatile devices which allow data to be stored as long as required by the user. This type of storage is much larger than primary memory, but data access time is considerably slower than RAM and ROM.</li>
<li>All applications, the operating system, device drivers and general files (for example, documents, photos and music) are stored on secondary storage.</li>
<li>principal operations of a magnetic hard disk:
<ul>
<li>The hard disk has (one or more) platter/plate/disk</li>
<li>Each surface of the platter/disk is (ferrous oxide which is) capable of being magnetised</li>
<li>The platters/disks are mounted on a (central) spindle</li>
<li>The entire mechanism is contained inside a sealed (aluminium) box.</li>
<li>The disks are rotated (at high-speed)</li>
<li>(Each surface of the disk) has a read/write head mounted on an arm (positioned just above the surface)</li>
<li>Electronic circuits control the movement of the arm (and hence the heads)</li>
<li>The surface of the platter/disk is divided into concentric tracks / circles</li>
<li>The surface of the platter/disk is divided into sectors</li>
<li>One track in one sector is the basic unit of storage called a block</li>
<li>The data is encoded as a magnetic pattern for each block</li>
<li>When writing to disk, a variation in the current in the head produces a variation in magnetic field on the disk</li>
<li>When reading from disk, a variation in magnetic field produces a variation in current through the head</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>principal operations of a magnetic hard disk:
<ul>
<li>flash memory store data by controlling the movement of electrons within NAND chips. The data is stored as 0s and 1s in millions of tiny transistors (at each junction one transistor is called a floating gate and the other is called a control gate) within the chip. This effectively produces a non-volatile rewritable memory.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>principal operations of a optical reader/writer:
<ul>
<li>Both CDs and DVDs use a single, spiral track which runs from the centre of the disk to the edge. When a disk spins, the optical head moves to the point where the laser beam ‘contacts’ the disk surface and follows the spiral track from the centre outwards. As with an HDD, a CD/DVD is divided into sectors allowing direct access of data. Also, as in the case of an HDD, the outer part of the disk runs faster than the inner part of the disk.</li>
<li>The data is stored in ‘pits’ and ‘bumps’ on the spiral track. A red laser is used to read and write the data. CDs and DVDs can be designated R (write once only) or RW (can be written to or read from many times).</li>

<li><strong>Direct 3D printing</strong> – 3D printing technique where print head moves in the x, y and z directions. Layers of melted material are built up using nozzles like an inkjet printer.</li>
<li><strong>Digital to analogue converter (DAC)</strong> – needed to convert digital data into electric currents that can drive motors, actuators and relays, for example.</li>
<li><strong>Analogue to digital converter (ADC)</strong> – needed to convert analogue data (read from sensors, for example) into a form understood by a computer.</li>
<li><strong>Organic LED (OLED)</strong> – uses movement of electrons between cathode and anode to produce an on-screen image. It generates its own light so no back lighting required.</li>
<li><strong>Screen resolution</strong> – number of pixels in the horizontal and vertical directions on a television/computer screen.</li>
<li><strong>Touch screen</strong> – screen on which the touch of a finger or stylus allows selection or manipulation of a screen image; they usually use capacitive or resistive technology.</li>
<li><strong>Capacitive</strong> – type of touch screen technology based on glass layers forming a capacitor, where fingers touching the screen cause a change in the electric field.</li>

<p>principal operations of laser printer:</p>
<ul>
<li>data from the document is sent to a printer driver</li>
<li>printer driver ensures that the data is in a format that the chosen printer can understand</li>
<li>check is made by the printer driver to ensure that the chosen printer is available to print (is it busy? is it off-line? is it out of ink? and so on)</li>
<li>data is sent to the printer and stored in a temporary memory known as a printer buffer</li>
<li>printing drum given a positive charge. As this drum rotates, a laser beam scans across it removing the positive charge in certain areas, leaving negatively charged areas which exactly match the text/images of the page to be printed</li>
<li>drum is coated with positively charged toner (powdered ink). Since the toner is positively charged, it only sticks to the negatively charged parts of the drum</li>
<li>negatively charged sheet of paper is rolled over the drum</li>
<li>toner on the drum sticks to the paper to produce an exact copy of the page sent to the printer</li>
<li>to prevent the paper sticking to the drum, the electric charge on the paper is removed after one rotation of the drum</li>
<li>the paper goes through a fuser (a set of heated rollers), where the heat melts the ink so that it fixes permanently to the paper</li>

<li>
<p>principal operations of speaker:</p>
<ul>
<li>The digital data is first passed through a digital to analogue converter (DAC) where it is converted into an electric current.</li>
<li>This is then passed through an amplifier (since the current generated by the DAC will be small) to create a current large enough to drive a loudspeaker.</li>
<li>This electric current is then fed to a loudspeaker where it is converted into sound.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>principal operations of microphone:</p>
<ul>
<li>When sound is created, it causes the air to vibrate.</li>
<li>When a diaphragm in the microphone picks up the air vibrations, the diaphragm also begins to vibrate.</li>
<li>A copper coil is wrapped around a permanent magnet and the coil is connected to the diaphragm using a cone. As the diaphragm vibrates, the cone moves in and out causing the copper coil to move backwards and forwards.</li>
<li>This forwards and backwards motion causes the magnetic field around the permanent magnet to be disturbed, inducing an electric current.</li>
<li>The electric current is then either amplified or sent to a recording device. The electric current is analogue in nature.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Touchscreen:</p>
<ul>
<li>capacitive:
<ul>
<li>Made up of many layers of glass that act like a capacitor creating electric fields between the glass plates in layers.</li>
<li>When the top glass layer is touched, the electric current changes and the coordinates where the screen was touched are determined by an on board microprocessor.</li>
<li>Benefits:
<ul>
<li>Medium cost technology.</li>
<li>Screen visibility is good even in strong sunlight.</li>
<li>Permits multi-touch capability.</li>
<li>Screen is very durable; it takes a major impact to break the glass.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Drawbacks:</li>
<li>Only allows use of bare fingers as the form of input; although the latest screens permit the use of a special stylus to be used.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>resistive:
<ul>
<li>Makes use of an upper layer of polyester (a form of plastic) and a bottom layer of glass.</li>
<li>When the top polyester layer is touched, the top layer and bottom layer complete a circuit.</li>
<li>Signals are then sent out, which are interpreted by a microprocessor and the calculations determine the coordinates of where the screen was touched.</li>
<li>Benefits:
<ul>
<li>Relatively inexpensive technology.</li>
<li>Possible to use bare fingers, gloved fingers or stylus to carry out an input operation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Drawbacks:
<ul>
<li>Screen visibility is poor in strong sunlight.</li>
<li>Does not permit multi-touch capability.</li>
<li>Screen durability is only fair; it is vulnerable to scratches and the screen wears out through time.</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>principal operations of virtual headset:</p>
<ul>
<li>Video is sent from a computer to the headset (either using an HDMI cable or a smartphone fitted into the headset).</li>
<li>Two feeds are sent to an LCD/OLED display (sometimes two screens are used, one for the left side of the image and one for the right side of the image); lenses placed between the eyes and the screen allow for focusing and reshaping of the image/video for each eye, thus giving a 3D effect and adding to the realism.</li>
<li>Most headsets use 110° field of view which is enough to give a pseudo 360° surround image/video.</li>
<li>A frame rate of 60 to 120 images per second is used to give a true/realistic image.</li>
<li>As the user moves their head (up and down or left to right), a series of sensors and/or LEDs measure this movement, which allows the image/video on the screen to react to the user’s head movements (sensors are usually gyroscopic or accelerometers; LEDs are used in conjunction with mini cameras to further monitor head movements).</li>
<li>Headsets also use binaural sound (surround sound) so that the speaker output appears to come from behind, from the side or from a distance, giving very realistic 3D sound.</li>
<li>Some headsets also use infrared sensors to monitor eye movement (in addition to head movement), which allows the depth of field on the screen to be more realistic; an example of this is to make objects in the foreground appear fuzzy when the user’s eyes indicate they are looking into the
distance (and vice versa).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>sensors:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>difference between monitoring  and control systems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Monitoring systems:
<ul>
<li>if new data is outside the acceptable range, a warning message is sent to a screen or an alarm is activated.</li>
<li>the microprocessor or computer has no effect on what is being monitored – it is simply ‘watching’ the process</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>control systems:
<ul>
<li>if the new data is outside the acceptable range, the microprocessor or computer sends signals to control valves, motors, and so on</li>
<li>the output from the system affects the next set of inputs from the sensors (feedback loop)</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p>the importance of feedback:</p>

<li>stored programs made up of instructions that could be executed in sequential order.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>stored program concept: Instructions and data are stored in the same memory space / in main memory.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="../../pictures/2023-04-30-15-29-43-image.png" alt=""></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The main components of the processor(CPU) are the arithmetic logic unit (ALU), the
control unit (CU), the system clock and the immediate access store (IAS).</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>ALU</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The ALU allows the required arithmetic or logic operations to be carried out while a program is being run. It is possible for a computer to have more than one ALU – one will perform fixed point operations and the other floating-point operations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The accumulator (ACC) is a temporary register used when carrying out ALU
calculations.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>CU</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The CU reads an instruction from memory. This instruction is then interpreted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the address of the location where the instruction can be found is stored in the program counter (PC).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During that process, signals are generated along the control bus to tell the other components in the computer what to do. The CU ensures synchronisation of data flow and program instructions throughout the computer.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>system clock</p>
<ul>
<li>A system clock is used to produce timing signals on the control bus to ensure this vital synchronisation takes place – without the clock the computer would simply crash.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>IAS</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The IAS is another name for primary (RAM) memory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The IAS holds all the data and programs that the processor (CPU) needs to access. The CPU takes data and programs held in backing store and puts them into the IAS temporarily.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is done because read/write operations carried out using the IAS are considerably faster than read/write operations to backing store. Consequently, any key data needed by an application will be stored temporarily in IAS to speed up operations.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>One of the most fundamental components of the Von Neumann system is the register. Registers can be general purpose or special purpose.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>General purpose registers hold data that is frequently used by the CPU or can be used by the programmer when addressing the CPU directly. The accumulator is a good example of a general purpose register and will be used as such throughout this book.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Special purpose registers have a specific function within the CPU and
hold the program state.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="../../pictures/2023-04-30-15-40-18-image.png" alt=""></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(System) buses are used in computers as a parallel transmission component; each wire in the bus transmits one bit of data. There are three common buses used in the Von Neumann architecture known as address bus, data bus and control bus.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Address bus</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>As the name suggests, the address bus carries addresses throughout the computer system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Between the CPU and memory the address bus is unidirectional.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bus width is important.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data bus</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The data bus is bidirectional.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This means data can be carried from CPU to memory (and vice versa) as well as to and from input/output devices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is important to point out that data can be an address, an instruction or a numerical value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bus width is important.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Control bus</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The control bus is also bidirectional.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It carries signals from the CU to all the other computer components. It only carries control signals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bus width is usually 8-bits.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="../../pictures/2023-04-30-15-44-18-image.png" alt=""></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>factors contribute to the performance of the computer system</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>bus width of address bus and data bus</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Address bus: the wider the bus, more memory locations can be addressed simultaneously.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data bus: the wider the bus, the larger the word length that can be transported. (A word is a group of bits which can be regarded as a single unit, for example, 16-bit, 32-bit or 64-bit word lengths are the most common).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Overclocking</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Each instruction is executed on a clock pulse. Increase in clock speed means more instructions can be executed per second.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the clock speed can be changed by accessing the basic input/output system (BIOS) and altering the settings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, using a clock speed higher than the computer was designed for can lead to problems, such as</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>execution of instructions outside design limits, which can lead to seriously unsynchronised operations (in other words, an instruction is unable to complete in time before the next one is due to be executed) and the computer would frequently crash and become unstable</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>serious overheating of the CPU leading to unreliable performance.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>cache memory</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It is similar to RAM in that its contents are lost when the power is turned off.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cache uses SRAM whereas most computers use DRAM for main memory. Therefore, cache memories will have faster access times, since there is no need to keep refreshing, which slows down access time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cache memory stores frequently used instructions and data that need to be accessed faster.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>cores</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>one core is made up of an ALU, a CU and the registers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each core processes one instruction per clock pulse, so increase the number of cores can increase the number of instructions executed per second.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The idea of using more cores alleviates the need to continually increase clock speeds.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Input and output devices are connected to a computer via ports.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>USB</p>

<p>Interrupts</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><img src="../../pictures/2023-04-30-16-35-16-image.png" alt=""></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An interrupt is a signal sent from a device or from software to the processor. This will cause the processor to temporarily stop what it is doing and service the interrupt.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>possible causes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>a timing signal</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>input/output processes(waiting for receiving data)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a hardware fault(e.g. printer has not enough ink)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>user interaction(&lsquo;break&rsquo; conmand)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a software error that cannot be ignored</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once the interrupt signal is received, the processor either carries on with what it was doing or stops to service the device/program that generated the interrupt. The computer needs to identify the interrupt type and also establish the level of interrupt priority.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Interrupts allow computers to carry out many tasks or to have several windows open at the same time. An example would be downloading a file from the internet at the same time as listening to some music from the computer library.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whenever an interrupt is serviced, the status of the current task being run is saved. The contents of the program counter and other registers are saved. Then, the interrupt service routine (ISR) is executed by loading the start address into the program counter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once the interrupt has been fully serviced, the status of the interrupted task is reinstated (contents of saved registers retrieved) and it continues from the point prior to the interrupt being sent.</p>

<p>Assembly language and machine code</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The only programming language that a CPU can use is machine code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In order to shorten the development time for writing computer programs, other programming languages were developed, where the instructions were easier to learn and understand. Any program not written in machine code needs to be translated before the CPU can carry out the instructions, so language translators were developed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The first programming language to be developed was assembly language, this is closely related to machine code and uses mnemonics instead of binary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The structure of assembly language and machine code instructions is the same. Each instruction has an opcode that identifies the operation to be carried out by the CPU. Most instructions also have an operand that identifies the data to be used by the opcode.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Pass 1</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Read the assembly language program one line at a time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ignore anything not required, such as comments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allocate a memory address for the line of code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check the opcode is in the instruction set.</p>
</li>
<li>
